This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Below are the available scripts to get started.

### Available Scripts

- Runs the app in development mode.  
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it.
- The page will automatically reload if you make edits.
- You may see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

- Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
- Refer to the [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more details.

### `npm run build`

- Builds the app for production into the `build` folder.
- Optimizes the React app for best performance.
- Filenames are hashed, and the app is minified for deployment.  
  See the [Deployment Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is a one-way operation, and it cannot be undone.
